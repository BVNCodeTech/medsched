medSCHED is an all-in-one application for all of your medical needs. At its core, it is a scheduler and a reminder app for your medicines, that is, it reminds you whenever you need to take a certain pill. It is especially aimed for those, who have trouble remembering or are too busy with their own schedule that they do not keep track of time. Another area where medSCHED will be helping people with is its own in-built mini DMS (Document Management System) for all of your prescriptions. With a simplified UI, it is targetted for senior people and for home usage.

medSCHED also comes with a web-scraper which would also show you related information about the medicine by searching on trusted sources.
